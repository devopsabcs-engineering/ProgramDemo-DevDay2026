Subject: Proposal for an After-School Tutoring and Mentorship Program

Dear Sir or Madam,

As a parent and school council member in Northern Ontario, I am writing to propose an "After-School Tutoring and Mentorship Program" to support students who are struggling academically, particularly in literacy and mathematics. The pandemic and other challenges have widened learning gaps for many students, especially those from marginalized or low-income backgrounds. This program would provide extra academic help and mentorship opportunities to students outside of regular school hours, helping them to catch up and excel in their studies.

**Description of the Proposed Program:**
The After-School Tutoring and Mentorship Program would be implemented in public elementary and secondary schools across Ontario, focusing on schools where standardized test scores or graduation rates indicate a need for additional support. The program would recruit qualified tutors (such as retired teachers, education students, or community volunteers) to provide free or low-cost small-group or one-on-one tutoring in core subjects like reading, writing, math, and science. Additionally, it would pair students with mentors — including older students, community role models, or professionals — to provide guidance, homework help, and encouragement. The program could be funded through a collaboration between the Ministry of Education and school boards, with potential support from community organizations or corporate sponsors to supply learning materials and snacks for participants.

**Objectives:**
- Improve literacy and numeracy skills among students who are performing below provincial standards or who have fallen behind due to disruptions (such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic).
- Increase students’ confidence and engagement in school by providing them with personalized support and positive role models through mentorship.
- Reduce achievement gaps associated with socio-economic status, ensuring that all students have the opportunity to succeed regardless of their background or family resources.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Higher test scores and improved classroom performance for participating students, as measured by better report card grades and standardized assessment results in reading and mathematics.
- Improved student attendance and graduation rates in schools that implement the program, as struggling students become more engaged and confident in their abilities.
- Enhanced social and emotional well-being of students, with mentored participants reporting greater motivation, self-esteem, and aspirations for post-secondary education or careers.

**Rationale for Government Support:**
Investing in education and student success has long-term benefits for our society and economy. When students receive the help they need early on, they are less likely to fall further behind, drop out of school, or require costly remedial education later. This proposed program aligns with the Ministry’s mandate to improve student achievement and ensure equitable education outcomes for all. Many families in rural or low-income areas cannot afford private tutoring for their children; a public after-school tutoring program would level the playing field. Additionally, involving community volunteers and older students as mentors will foster a strong sense of community and civic engagement. This program would not only help students academically but also contribute to training future educators and leaders by giving volunteers and youth mentors meaningful teaching and leadership experience.

In summary, I urge the Government of Ontario to adopt the After-School Tutoring and Mentorship Program to help our students thrive. By providing extra academic support and mentorship, we can address learning gaps, promote equity in education, and empower the next generation to reach their full potential. Thank you for your consideration of this proposal. I am happy to discuss this idea further and answer any questions you may have.

Sincerely,
